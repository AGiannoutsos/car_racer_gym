# CarRacing-v0

Here we have an assignment in course: Reinforcement Learning, where we have been experimented with three major algorithms, so as to solve Car_Racing_v0 problem from Gym.AI environment. Note that Car_Racing_v0 belongs to 'Box2D' family of popular RL problems.

## Deep Q-Network (DQN)

## Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

## Actor-Critic
