# CarRacing-v0

1. Here we have an assignment in course: Reinforcement Learning, where we have been experimented with three major algorithms, so as to solve Car_Racing_v0 problem from Gym.AI environment. Note that Car_Racing_v0 belongs to [Box2D](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d) family of popular RL problems. 

2. You can check for detailed information about these three RL algorithms here [Report](https://github.com/spympr/car_racer_gym/tree/), where we analyzed them each one seperately. Also, it includes information about our experiments and setup and conclusions of them.

3. In folder [GIFs](https://github.com/spympr/car_racer_gym/tree/main/GIFs) you can select whichever RL algorithm you prefer in order to observe all evaluation performance's videos (which we convert them to GIFs), that we managed to make with different number of timesteps.
