# CarRacing-v0

Here we have an assignment in course: Reinforcement Learning, where we have been experimented with three major algorithms, so as to solve Car_Racing_v0 problem from Gym.AI environment. 

Note that Car_Racing_v0 belongs to 'Box2D' family of popular RL problems. 

You can check for detailed information about these three RL algorithms in this pdf ~LINK_TO_PDF~, where we analyzed them each one seperately. 

In addition, in folder [Results](https://github.com/spympr/car_racer_gym/tree/main/Results) you can select whichever RL algorithm you prefer in order to observe all experiment's charts and evaluation performance's videos, that we managed to make.

## Deep Q-Network (DQN)

## Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

## Actor-Critic
