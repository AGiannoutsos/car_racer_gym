# CarRacing-v0

1. Here we have an assignment in course: Reinforcement Learning, where we have been experimented with three major algorithms, so as to solve Car_Racing_v0 problem from Gym.AI environment. Note that Car_Racing_v0 belongs to [Box2D](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d) family of popular RL problems. 

2. You can check for detailed information about these three RL algorithms here [Report](https://github.com/spympr/car_racer_gym/tree/), where we analyzed them each one seperately. Also, it includes information about our experiments and setup and conclusions of them.

3. In folder [Videos](https://github.com/spympr/car_racer_gym/tree/main/Videos) you can select whichever RL algorithm you prefer in order to observe all evaluation performance's videos, that we managed to make, with different number of timesteps.
